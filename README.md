# Laravel Mix PHP Function

## About
A lightweight and simple library that adds Laravel Mix's mix() function to your PHP project ðŸš€

You can now use the mix() function of Laravel Mix independently, without needing Laravel and/or Blade and/or Vue...

## Installation
`composer require ejetar/laravel-mix-php-function`

## Get started
1. Load the composer into your project;
2. Call mix() at the desired location;
3. And that's it, that's all, have fun!

### Example
Let's say we have the following `mix-manifest.json`, in the **public folder** of our project:
```json
{
    "/css/all.css": "/css/all.css?id=2fcc406cf38a7867b239",
    "/css/all.min.css": "/css/all.min.css?id=2fcc406cf38a7867b239", 
    "/js/all.js": "/js/all.js?id=2c80a6c15449d3e693ed", 
    "/js/all.min.js": "/js/all.min.js?id=2c80a6c15449d3e693ed"
}
```

Now suppose I want to retrieve the versioned URL from the _/css/all.min.css_ file:
```php
<?php require_once 'vendor/autoload.php'; //Load Composer ?><!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0">
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
        <title>Example</title>
        
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="<?= mix('/css/all.min.css'); ?>">
        <!-- The result will be /css/all.min.css?id=2fcc406cf38a7867b239 -->
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>\o/</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

That simple!

## Custom Mix Base URLs
You can also use custom mix base URLs, just as you would with Laravel.

Just define the constant `MIX_ASSET_URL` before using the mix function.

### Example
```php
<?php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php'; //Load Composer
define('MIX_ASSET_URL', 'https://cdn.example.com');
?><!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0">
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
        <title>Example</title>
        
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="<?= mix('/css/all.min.css'); ?>">
        <!-- The result will be https://cdn.example.com/css/all.min.css?id=2fcc406cf38a7867b239 -->
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>\o/</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```
